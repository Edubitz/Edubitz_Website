    title: Our Mission
    content: >-
      We first started as a duo, teaching middle schoolers at our school. The rising demand in computer science jobs, and the importance of STEM proficiency in a modern society is why we wanted to ensure younger individuals of our generation have the capacity to appreciate sciences and engineering. 

      Check out our video resources, as well as abundant educational oppotunities we display on our site.
