          I had a ton of fun with this class and learned a lot about coding and electronics. Both of the teachers were amazing and came to class with goals in mind and always something new to teach. I also had a lot of fun learning how to solder and it's many uses. Overall, it was a great experience with the teachers and subject mater and I would do it again if I could.

          I thought the projects in this class were really unique and fun. My favorite project overall was Ethical hacking as I thought it was a creative approach to a topic that I wasn't familiar with.
